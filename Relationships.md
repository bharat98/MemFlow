## USE CASE 1: Learning & Skill Development Decisions

**TRIGGER:** User asks about learning new technologies, skills, or frameworks ("Should I learn X?", "Is X worth it?")

**RELEVANT CONTEXT:**
*   **Job Timeline:** March 2026 employment deadline (Pull from: `Job/README For AI.md`)
*   **Positioning:** Enterprise SaaS + AI security bridge (Pull from: `Job/Identity/Identity.md`)
*   **Current Work Style:** System design/Orchestration over heavy coding (Pull from: `Projects/Projects.md`)
*   **Target Roles:** Solutions Engineer, Implementation Consultant (Pull from: `Job/Identity/Identity.md`)
*   **Current Gaps:** (Pull from: `Job/Upskill/DevSecOps Pro.md` or `Job/Upskill/Upskill.md`)

**RELATIONSHIP CHAIN:**
*   New Skill → **Demonstrates** → Technical Credibility → **Required By** → Positioning Strategy
*   New Skill → **Builds On** → Current Projects (e.g., Local LLM, OAuth) → **Shows** → Progression
*   New Skill → **Enables** → Portfolio Project → **Needed For** → Interviews (Jan 2026)
*   New Skill → **Creates** → LinkedIn Content → **Supports** → Personal Brand
*   Learning Timeline → **Constrained By** → March 2026 Deadline (Must complete by Jan 2026)

**ANSWER STRUCTURE:**
1.  **YES/NO with confidence level**
2.  **Strategic Fit:** How it supports "Enterprise SaaS + AI security bridge" positioning.
3.  **Project Integration:** How it builds on current work (e.g., "Can you add this to the Browser Automation project?").
4.  **Timeline Reality:** Can this be learned enough to demonstrate by Jan 2026?
5.  **Portfolio Value:** Will this generate a specific artifact for interviews?
6.  **Action Plan:** Specific dates and "definition of done".

## USE CASE 2: LinkedIn Content Creation

**TRIGGER:** "Write a LinkedIn post", "Help me post about X", "Content ideas"

**RELEVANT CONTEXT:**
*   **Content Strategy:** Technical depth + business bridge (Pull from: `Job/Identity/Linkedin/`)
*   **Brand Voice:** "The Fixer", Industrializing delivery (Pull from: `Job/Identity/Identity.md`)
*   **Recent Work:** (Pull from: `Projects/Personal/` directories)
*   **Strategic Goal:** Visibility for H1B-friendly roles (Pull from: `Job/README For AI.md`)

**RELATIONSHIP CHAIN:**
*   LinkedIn Content → **Supports** → Job Search Visibility (March 2026 Goal)
*   Post Topic → **Must Align With** → Positioning (Technical + Business Bridge)
*   Content → **Draws From** → Recent Project Struggles/Wins (Authenticity)
*   Post Tone → **Avoids** → Generic Career Advice (Identity Requirement)
*   Learning Journey → **Creates** → "Build in Public" Content opportunities

**ANSWER STRUCTURE:**
1.  **Hook:** Attention-grabbing, relevant to Target Roles (SE/Implementation).
2.  **Core Value:** Technical insight or "war story" from Projects/Career History.
3.  **Strategic Alignment:** Why this specific post helps get an SE job.
4.  **Call to Action:** Engagement driver appropriate for professional network.

## USE CASE 3: Project Selection & Prioritization

**TRIGGER:** "Should I build X?", "What project next?", "Is this worth my time?"

**RELEVANT CONTEXT:**
*   **Portfolio Needs:** Demonstrate technical credibility without "heavy coding" (Pull from: `Job/Identity/Identity.md`)
*   **Work Style:** AI Automation, Orchestration, System Design (Pull from: `Projects/Projects.md`)
*   **Timeline:** Completion before Interview Stage (Pull from: `Job/README For AI.md`)
*   **Skill Gaps:** (Pull from: `Job/Upskill/`)

**RELATIONSHIP CHAIN:**
*   Project → **Must Demonstrate** → Skills for Solutions Engineer/Implementation roles
*   Project → **Should Build On** → Existing work (OAuth, Local LLM) to save time
*   Project → **Needs Completion** → By January 2026 (Interview Prep Timeline)
*   Project Complexity → **Matches** → Work Style (Orchestration/AI Tools vs. Low-level coding)
*   Project → **Creates** → Interview Stories + LinkedIn Content

**ANSWER STRUCTURE:**
1.  **Verdict:** High/Medium/Low Priority.
2.  **Role Relevance:** Does this prove you can do the job of an SE?
3.  **Feasibility:** Can this be finished by Jan 2026 given "Not heavy coder" constraint?
4.  **Asset Generation:** What specific artifact will this produce for the portfolio?

## USE CASE 4: Job Application Strategy

**TRIGGER:** "Should I apply here?", "Tailor resume for Y", "Is this a good fit?"

**RELEVANT CONTEXT:**
*   **Company Profile:** B2B SaaS, 50-200 employees (Pull from: `Job/Identity/Identity.md`)
*   **Constraints:** H1B Sponsorship, $70k floor (Pull from: `Job/README For AI.md`)
*   **Experience:** HighRadius 4yrs, M.Eng (Pull from: `Job/Career-History/`)
*   **Resume Source:** (Pull from: `Job/Master Resume/`)

**RELATIONSHIP CHAIN:**
*   Company → **Must Offer** → H1B Sponsorship (Non-negotiable)
*   Role → **Must Fit** → SE / Implementation Consultant / TAM
*   Application → **Leverages** → Specific HighRadius "War Stories"
*   Resume → **Highlights** → Relevant Projects (Security + Automation)
*   Timeline → **Requires** → Offer by March 2026

**ANSWER STRUCTURE:**
1.  **Fit Assessment:** Visa match? Role match? Salary match?
2.  **Strategy:** Which "Identity" angle to pitch (Security specialist vs. Implementation expert).
3.  **Evidence:** Which Project or Career Story proves fitness for *this specific* JD.
4.  **Resume Tweaks:** Specific keywords to inject from Master Resume.

## CRITICAL RELATIONSHIPS SUMMARY

### 1. The "March 2026 Deadline" Impact
*   **Learning:** Must stop expanding breadth and focus on depth/demonstration by Jan 2026.
*   **Projects:** Must be scoped to <4 weeks to ensure completion before interviews.
*   **Applications:** Volume must increase if specific milestones aren't met.

### 2. The "H1B Sponsorship" Impact
*   **Company Selection:** Filters out ~70% of potential employers. Focus on "Sponsorship History" over "Sponsorship Potential".
*   **Negotiation:** Constraints on salary floor ($70k) vs. market rate.

### 3. The "Positioning" Impact (Enterprise SaaS + AI Security Bridge)
*   **Skill Selection:** Prioritize LangChain/Security tools over generic web dev (React/CSS).
*   **Content:** Post about *integrating* AI safely, not just *using* AI.
*   **Resume:** Highlight the M.Eng + HighRadius combo as "Secure Implementation".

### 4. The "Work Style" Impact (Not Heavy Coder)
*   **Projects:** Focus on **Architecture & Integration** (e.g., "How I connected X to Y securely") rather than "How I wrote a custom compiler".
*   **Tools:** Lean heavily on AI-assisted coding (Claude/Cursor) and low-code orchestration.
*   **Role Fit:** Solutions Engineer is better than Core Software Engineer because it values *system understanding* over *syntax memorization*.

### 5. Current Projects Impact
*   **Local LLM Browser Automation:** Proves "AI Automation" capability.
*   **Facebook OAuth:** Proves "Identity/Security" capability.
*   **Next Step:** Combine these? (e.g., Securely automating a browser task using local LLM inference).
