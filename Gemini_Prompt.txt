TASK: Analyze my Obsidian vault and create a Relationships.md file that makes implicit connections explicit for AI assistants.

CONTEXT:
I'm conducting a job search with these critical constraints:
- Employment deadline: March 2026 (3 months remaining)
- Visa: OPT expires July 2026, need H1B sponsorship
- Target: Solutions Engineer, Implementation Consultant roles ($90-100K)
- Positioning: Enterprise SaaS implementation + AI security bridge
- Background: 4 years HighRadius (Fortune 500 clients), Cybersecurity M.Eng
- Work style: NOT heavy coder - system design, AI automation, orchestration

VAULT STRUCTURE YOU'RE ANALYZING:
Job/
├── README For AI.md (master guide, timeline, success metrics)
├── Identity/
│   ├── Identity.md (positioning, target roles, compensation)
│   └── Linkedin/ (content strategy)
├── Career-History/ (work experience, stories, accomplishments)
├── Master Resume/ (source content)
├── Upskill/ (learning resources, DevSecOps Pro)
├── Apply/ (application tracking)
└── Outreach/ (networking strategy)

Projects/
├── Personal/ (Claude Code, Local LLM Browser Automation, OAuth work)
├── Professional/
└── Projects.md (describes AI-powered workflows, system design work)

YOUR GOAL:
Create relationship mappings for these specific AI assistant use cases:

---

## USE CASE 1: Learning/Skill Development Decisions

TRIGGER PHRASES: "Should I learn X?", "Is X worth learning?", "What should I focus on?"

EXAMPLE QUERY: "Should I learn LangChain/LangGraph?"

PULL CONTEXT FROM:
- Job/README For AI.md → [Extract: March 2026 deadline, H1B requirement]
- Job/Identity/Identity.md → [Extract: Target roles (SE, Implementation), positioning strategy, what I want to be known for]
- Projects/Projects.md → [Extract: Current work (AI automation, OAuth), NOT heavy coder, uses AI tools]
- Projects/Personal/ → [Extract: Specific projects like Local LLM Browser Automation, Claude Code]
- Job/Upskill/ → [Extract: Current learning priorities, gaps]
- Job/Identity/Linkedin/ → [Extract: Content strategy if available]

RELATIONSHIPS TO MAKE EXPLICIT:
- New skill SUPPORTS positioning as "Enterprise SaaS + AI security bridge"
- New skill DEMONSTRATES technical credibility (Identity requirement)
- Learning MUST COMPLETE by January 2026 (interview prep timeline)
- Skill CREATES LinkedIn content opportunity (technical depth posts)
- Current projects INFORM next logical skill to learn (progression path)
- Portfolio REQUIRES demonstrable project using new skill
- Target roles REQUIRE specific technical capabilities (match to JDs)

OUTPUT FORMAT FOR THIS USE CASE:
```markdown
## Learning & Skill Development Decisions

TRIGGER: User asks about learning new technologies, skills, or frameworks

RELEVANT CONTEXT:
Job Timeline: March 2026 employment deadline (Job/README For AI.md)
Positioning: Enterprise SaaS + AI security bridge (Job/Identity/Identity.md)
Current Technical Work: {list from Projects/}
Target Roles: Solutions Engineer, Implementation Consultant (Job/Identity/Identity.md)
Learning Constraints: {from Job/Upskill/}
Content Strategy: {from Job/Identity/Linkedin/ if exists}

RELATIONSHIP CHAIN:
New Skill → Demonstrates → Technical Credibility → Required By → Positioning Strategy
New Skill → Builds On → Current Projects → Shows → Progression
New Skill → Enables → Portfolio Project → Needed For → Interviews (Jan 2026)
New Skill → Creates → LinkedIn Content → Supports → Personal Brand
Learning Timeline → Constrained By → March 2026 Deadline

ANSWER STRUCTURE:
1. YES/NO with confidence level
2. How it supports positioning strategy
3. How it builds on current work (Projects/)
4. Timeline fit (completion by Jan 2026?)
5. Portfolio/interview value
6. LinkedIn content opportunity
7. Specific action plan with dates
```

## USE CASE 2: LinkedIn Content Creation

TRIGGER PHRASES: "Write a LinkedIn post", "Help me post about X", "LinkedIn content"

PULL CONTEXT FROM:
- Job/Identity/Linkedin/ → [Content strategy, past posts if available]
- Job/Identity/Identity.md → [Positioning: "technical depth, not generic"]
- Projects/ → [Recent work to showcase]
- Job/Upskill/ → [Learning journeys to document]
- Job/README For AI.md → [Strategic goals: visibility, positioning]

RELATIONSHIPS TO MAKE EXPLICIT:
- LinkedIn content SUPPORTS job search visibility goal
- Posts MUST ALIGN with positioning strategy (technical + business bridge)
- Content DRAWS FROM recent Projects/ work (authenticity)
- Posts AVOID generic career advice (Identity requirement)
- Learning journeys CREATE content opportunities
- Content REINFORCES "Enterprise SaaS + AI security" niche

---

## USE CASE 3: Project Selection & Prioritization

TRIGGER PHRASES: "Should I build X?", "What project should I work on?", "Is this project worth it?"

PULL CONTEXT FROM:
- Job/Identity/Identity.md → [Portfolio needs, what to be known for]
- Projects/Projects.md → [Current work, style: NOT heavy coding]
- Job/README For AI.md → [Timeline: before interview stage]
- Job/Upskill/ → [Skill gaps to address]

RELATIONSHIPS TO MAKE EXPLICIT:
- Projects MUST DEMONSTRATE skills for target roles
- Projects SHOULD BUILD ON existing work (OAuth, AI automation)
- Projects NEED COMPLETION by January 2026 (interview timeline)
- Projects CREATE LinkedIn content + interview stories
- Project complexity MATCHES work style (AI tools, orchestration, not heavy coding)
- Portfolio ADDRESSES positioning strategy (Enterprise + AI security)

---

## USE CASE 4: Job Application Strategy

TRIGGER PHRASES: "Should I apply to X?", "Is this company a good fit?", "Tailor my resume for Y"

PULL CONTEXT FROM:
- Job/Identity/Identity.md → [Target company profile, compensation floor]
- Job/README For AI.md → [H1B sponsorship requirement, timeline]
- Job/Career-History/ → [Experience to highlight]
- Projects/ → [Portfolio to reference]
- Job/Master Resume/ → [Content to customize]

RELATIONSHIPS TO MAKE EXPLICIT:
- Company MUST SPONSOR H1B (non-negotiable constraint)
- Role MUST FIT target profiles (SE, Implementation Consultant)
- Compensation MUST MEET $70K floor
- Application LEVERAGES Career-History stories
- Resume HIGHLIGHTS relevant Projects
- Timeline REQUIRES offer by March 2026

---

CRITICAL RELATIONSHIPS TO CAPTURE:

1. MARCH 2026 DEADLINE impacts:
   - All learning must complete by Jan 2026
   - Portfolio projects need demonstration timeline
   - LinkedIn content creation urgency
   - Application volume requirements

2. H1B SPONSORSHIP impacts:
   - Company selection criteria
   - Compensation negotiation constraints
   - Application filtering priorities

3. POSITIONING STRATEGY ("Enterprise SaaS + AI security bridge") impacts:
   - Skill selection priorities
   - Project selection criteria
   - LinkedIn content themes
   - Resume customization angle

4. WORK STYLE (AI tools, orchestration, NOT heavy coding) impacts:
   - Project complexity decisions
   - Skill learning priorities (LangChain vs low-level implementation)
   - Role fit assessment

5. CURRENT PROJECTS (OAuth, AI automation) impact:
   - Next logical skill progression
   - Portfolio narrative (showing progression)
   - LinkedIn content authenticity

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use clear markdown headers for each use case
- List specific file paths (Job/Identity/Identity.md, not just "identity notes")
- Make relationship chains explicit with arrows (→)
- Include timeline constraints in EVERY relevant section
- Specify WHY relationships matter (not just THAT they exist)
- Use WHEN/PULL/RELATIONSHIPS structure consistently
- Focus on ACTIONABLE connections that help AI give personalized advice
